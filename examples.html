<dt>Automation</dt>
<dd>When paired with AI technologies, automation tools can expand the volume and types of tasks performed. An example is 
robotic process automation (RPA), a type of software that automates repetitive, rules-based data processing tasks traditionally 
done by humans. When combined with machine learning and emerging AI tools,</dd>

<dt>Machine learning</dt>
<dd>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that, in very simple terms, can be thought of as the automation 
of predictive analytics. There are three types of machine learning algorithms:
<ul><li>Supervised learning</li><li>Unsupervised learning</li><li>Reinforcement learning</li>
</dd>

<dt>Self-driving cars</dt>
<dd>Autonomous vehicles use a combination of computer vision, image recognition and deep learning to build automated skill 
at piloting a vehicle while staying in a given lane and avoiding unexpected obstructions, such as pedestrians.</dd>
