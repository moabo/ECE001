<h2>Ethical use of ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
<p>
	
While AI tools present a range of new functionality for businesses, the use of artificial intelligence also raises ethical 
questions because, for better or worse, an AI system will reinforce what it has already learned.

This can be problematic because machine learning algorithms, which underpin many of the most advanced AI tools, 
are only as smart as the data they are given in training. Because a human being selects what data is used to train an AI program, 
the potential for machine learning bias is inherent and must be monitored closely.

Anyone looking to use machine learning as part of real-world, in-production systems needs to factor ethics into their AI 
training processes and strive to avoid bias. This is especially true when using AI algorithms that are inherently 
unexplainable in deep learning and generative adversarial network (GAN) applications.
