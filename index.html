<h2>WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?</h2>
<p>
	Back in the 1950s, the fathers of the field Minsky and McCarthy, described artificial intelligence as any task performed 
	by a program or a machine that, if a human carried out the same activity, we would say the human had to apply intelligence 
	to accomplish the task.

	That obviously is a fairly broad definition, which is why you will sometimes see arguments over whether something is truly AI or not.

	AI systems will typically demonstrate at least some of the following behaviours associated with human intelligence: 
	planning, learning, reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and manipulation and, 
	to a lesser extent, social intelligence and creativity.
